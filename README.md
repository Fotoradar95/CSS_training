# CSS_training
  My first trials with HTML combined with CSS - I wanted to create simple site to practise positioning, linking images and overlying background and images. 
  Tried and used such a tools as: Color pickers, division elements, classes, background removing tool, gradient background kolor picker, font size in different ways (difference between em and px), margin, padding size, adding web safe fonts and specific fonts "plugins" and for the final i tried some mouseover effects on images.
  
  After that, I will head on for Bootstrap practice to gain basic Web coding knowledge before starting JS practise.
