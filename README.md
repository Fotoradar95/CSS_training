# CSS_training
  My first trials using CSS combined with HTML - I wanted to create simple site to practise positioning, linking images and overlying background and images. 
  Tried and used such a tools as: Color pickers, division elements, classes, background removing tool, gradient background kolor picker, font size in different ways (difference
  between em and px), margin, padding size, adding web safe fonts and specific fonts "plugins" and for the final i tried some mouseover effects on images.
